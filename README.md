Issues for CADC
===============

We are investigating possibilities for a single framework for tracking development and maintenance within CADC, or at least CANFAR. The feature list is the following

* integration: "user stories", software bugs, operations issues, features requests into one single tracking system
* grouping: multiple issues into into one group, and across repositories for iteration planning and releases
* tagging: tag issues by type (feature request, bug, operations, storage,...) 
* assigning: issues can be assigned or de-assigned
* open: users can search, browse, open new issues, and comment on existing issues
* anonymous: somehow keep a portal for anonymous users who don't like to
* timing: set deadlines, time tracking (is it mandatory) ?
* no-maintenance: hopefully we would use services so we don't rely on our or SSC for maintaining the tracking framework
* no-human-filter: avoid as much as possible the need of a human to filter the various issues at first (the helpdesk bucket model)
